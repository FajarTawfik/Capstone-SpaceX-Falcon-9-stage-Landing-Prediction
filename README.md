# **Capstone: SpaceX Falcon 9 Stage Landing Predictions**

In this project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises its Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million. In contrast, other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch. A significant portion of SpaceX's savings comes from the ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket.

By accurately predicting the success of the first stage landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This prediction model could be valuable for other companies aiming to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches, providing insights into potential cost savings and competitive pricing.
